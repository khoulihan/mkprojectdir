# mkprojectdir

A script to create standard directory structures for projects.

License: MIT, see LICENSE for more details.

## Prerequisites

The script depends on Python 3.7 (though possibly earlier versions of Python 3 will work fine).

## Usage

The script takes two arguments - a project template and a destination. The template is copied to the destination.

### Project Template

The project template can be a path to a directory, or the name of a template in the `project_templates` directory in the script's config directory (`~/.config/mkprojectdir` by default).
